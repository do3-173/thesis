\section{Research Questions}
\label{sec:research_questions}

\edo{TODO: This entire section needs to be discussed with Loris. The current research questions were too broad and focused on aspects not aligned with the actual experimental work. Need to define specific, focused research questions that address: (1) Experimental evaluation of current LLM-based FE approaches, (2) Text-based feature engineering effectiveness, (3) Performance boundaries compared to traditional methods, (4) Practical deployment considerations. Schedule meeting with Loris to finalize the research questions before proceeding with this section.}
