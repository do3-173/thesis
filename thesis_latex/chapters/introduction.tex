\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}

The rapid evolution of machine learning and artificial intelligence has transformed how we approach data analysis and predictive modeling. Among the most significant recent developments is the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) as powerful tools for understanding and manipulating various forms of data, including structured tabular datasets. This thesis investigates the application of LLMs to automated feature engineering, a critical component of the machine learning pipeline that has traditionally required extensive domain expertise and manual effort.
